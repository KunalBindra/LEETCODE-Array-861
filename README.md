# LEETCODE-Array-861
This Java code calculates the maximum score of a binary matrix by performing row and column operations. Let's walk through it:

1. The method `matrixScore` takes a 2D array of integers `grid` representing the binary matrix and returns the maximum score achievable.

2. It initializes `ans` to the number of rows (`m`) because all cells in the first column are forced to be 1, and each row contributes one to the score.

3. Then, it iterates through each column starting from the second column (index 1) up to the last column.

4. In each iteration, it counts the number of ones in the current column (`onesCount`). This count indicates how many rows need to be flipped to make the majority of the column either 0 or 1, whichever requires fewer flips.

5. It updates the `ans` by multiplying it by 2 (since we're shifting to the next column) and adding the maximum count of ones or zeros in the column. This ensures that the score is maximized.

Let's do a dry run with a simple example:

```java
int[][] grid = {
  {0, 0, 1},
  {1, 0, 1},
  {0, 1, 0}
};
```

Here's the dry run:

- Initial `ans = 3`, because there are 3 rows.
- For the second column:
  - `onesCount = 1`, because there's one 1 in the column.
  - `m - onesCount = 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - So, `ans` becomes `3 * 2 + 1 = 7`.
- For the third column:
  - `onesCount = 2`, because there are two 1s in the column.
  - `m - onesCount = 2 - 2 = 0`.
  - So, `ans` becomes `7 * 2 + 2 = 16`.

Final `ans` is 16, which is the maximum score achievable for this matrix.

The code efficiently calculates this maximum score using the described strategy.
